# Lagos Housing Price Prediction Model

This repository focuses on building and analyzing a machine learning model that predicts housing prices in Lagos. The aim is to make property valuation more transparent and data-driven for citizens. Using real-world property listings and known prices, the model takes into account key features such as location, house type, number of bedrooms, and other relevant characteristics to estimate a property's market value.

## Problem Statement

"How can we accurately predict the price of a house or rental property in Nigerian cities based on features like location, number of rooms, property type, and amenities, to improve transparency and decision-making in the real estate market?"

In Nigeria, finding fair and accurate pricing for housing remains a difficult task due to the absence of centralized pricing data, regional disparities, and inconsistent listing standards. This project aims to build a predictive model to address this challenge.

## Features (from the dataset)

The data used in this project were obtained from Kaggle.
Link: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdullahiyunus/nigeria-houses-and-prices-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdullahiyunus/nigeria-houses-and-prices-dataset)

The features contained in this dataset are as follows:
* `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms in the houses.
* `bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms in the houses.
* `toilets`: Number of toilets.
* `parking_space`: Number of parking spaces available.
* `title`: Type of house (e.g., Detached Duplex, Terraced Duplexes).
* `town`: Town in which the house is located.
* `state`: State within Nigeria in which the house is located.
* `price`: The target column (housing price).

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project and run the notebooks locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this GitHub repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/T-emi-dayo/House-Price-Prediction-Lagos-Real-Estate-](https://github.com/T-emi-dayo/House-Price-Prediction-Lagos-Real-Estate-.git)
cd House-Price-Prediction-Lagos-Real-Estate
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

**Using `venv` (Python's built-in virtual environment):**

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Using `conda` (if you have Anaconda/Miniconda installed):**

```bash
conda create --name housing_price_env python=3.9
conda activate housing_price_env
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

With your virtual environment activated, install all required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Data Preparation

The raw dataset (`nigeria_houses_data.csv`) is expected to be in a `dataset/` subfolder.

The `data_preprocessing_and_analysis.ipynb` notebook will read this raw data, perform cleaning and feature engineering, and then save a processed version (`Lagos_Housing.csv`) which is used by the `modelling.ipynb` notebook.

### 5. Run the Jupyter Notebooks

To run the analysis and model training, start a Jupyter Notebook server from your activated environment:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then, open and run the cells in the following notebooks in order:
1.  `data_preprocessing_and_analysis.ipynb`
2.  `modelling.ipynb`

## Data Preprocessing and Analysis (`data_preprocessing_and_analysis.ipynb`)

This notebook covers:
* **Loading the Dataset:** Imports `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly.express`, `plotly.graph_objects`, `sklearn.model_selection`, `sklearn.ensemble`, `sklearn.metrics`.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Basic information (`df.info()`) and checking for missing values (`df.isna().sum()`).
    * Descriptive statistics (`df.describe(include="all")`).
    * Initial observations about data range and unique values (e.g., high price skew, number of states/towns).
    * Visualization of town and state counts using countplots.
* **Feature Engineering:**
    * Handling categorical features (`title`, `town`, `state`) by converting them to numerical representations (e.g., using `factorize` or one-hot encoding).
    * Creating a `log_price` column for target transformation to handle skewness.
    * Dropping original categorical columns and the original `price` column.
    * Saving the processed data to `dataset/Lagos_Housing.csv`.
* **Conclusion:** Summarizes insights from the analysis, such as the dominance of Lagos data, importance of bedrooms, and most expensive locations/house types.

## Model Training and Evaluation (`modelling.ipynb`)

This notebook focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models for housing price prediction:
* **Importing Libraries:** Imports `pandas`, `numpy`, `warnings`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `seaborn`, `StandardScaler`, `MinMaxScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing`, various modules from `sklearn.model_selection` (e.g., `train_test_split`, `RandomizedSearchCV`, `GridSearchCV`, `cross_val_score`), `RandomForestRegressor`, `LinearRegression`, `SVR`, `XGBRegressor` from `sklearn.ensemble` and `sklearn.linear_model` and `xgboost` respectively.
* **Data Loading:** Loads the `Lagos_Housing.csv` dataset.
* **Feature Selection:** Defines `X` (features) and `y` (target `log_price`).
* **Data Splitting:** Splits data into training, validation, and test sets (`train_test_split`).
* **Feature Scaling:** Applies `StandardScaler` to the features.
* **Baseline Model:** Establishes a baseline model (e.g., using the median of prices) for comparison.
* **Model Training:** Trains various regression models (e.g., RandomForestRegressor, LinearRegression, SVR, XGBRegressor).
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Uses `RandomizedSearchCV` or `GridSearchCV` for optimizing model hyperparameters.
* **Cross-Validation:** Evaluates models using cross-validation.
* **Evaluation:** Assesses model performance using metrics such as:
    * R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
    * Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
    * Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    * Mean Squared Log Error (MSLE)
* **Prediction Visualization:** Plots predicted prices against actual prices to visualize model fit.
* **Model Saving:** Saves the trained model using `pickle`.

## Evaluation Metrics

The models are evaluated using the following metrics:
* **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination):** Measures how well future samples are likely to be predicted by the model.
* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Measures the average magnitude of the errors.
* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Measures the average magnitude of the errors without considering their direction.
* **Mean Squared Log Error (MSLE):** Useful when you care more about relative errors than absolute errors.

## Future Enhancements

* **Deployment:** Deploy the trained model as a web service or API for real-time predictions.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** Create a user-friendly web application (e.g., using Dash or Streamlit) to allow users to input house features and get price predictions.
* **More Data Sources:** Integrate additional datasets for a more comprehensive analysis.
* **Advanced Models:** Experiment with more complex machine learning or deep learning models.
* **Geospatial Analysis:** Incorporate more detailed geographical features and visualizations.
